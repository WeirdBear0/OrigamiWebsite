                    <p class="text">
                        Before becoming a physicist, before being the editor in chief of the Journal of Quantum Electronics, before helping NASA design its largest space telescope, Robert Lang learned to fold paper. Already a numbers whiz at age six, Lang had trouble sitting still during math class. His teacher gave him an origami book to keep him occupied and Lang started to fold.

                            A hospital assistant says folding more than 150 paper animals, skeletons and Yodas has "got him through lockdown".

                            Alex Ray, who works at Bristol Children's Hospital, has been practising origami for 20 years, but since the start of the pandemic his paper passion has "gone a bit crazy".

                            He said: "Since lockdown, I've made three times what I normally would and I'm running out of places to put them.

                            "I've also been working on the complex ones, which can take weeks to make."

                            Meet the Finnish origami artist who turns brilliant ideas into reality, simply by folding paper.

                            23-year-old Juho Könkkölä began folding origami models when he was just eight years old. More than a decade of practice has made him super skilled in his chosen endeavor. Making paper characters inspired from history, folk tales, books, movies, mythologies, and more, every piece of art Könkkölä makes is folded from a single square sheet of paper—and there’s never any cutting involved.

                            In the face of recent anti-Asian hate and attacks nationwide, a San Francisco artist and business owner decided to launch a movement inspired by a Japanese tradition and the art of origami.

                            In Japan, there's a tradition that you fold origami cranes to make a wish, but this artist found a new way to show the power of paper.
